# VIP Services for Online Game (Anonymous)

This repository showcases advanced automation tools for an online game, featuring deep image processing, AI techniques, and parallel processing. The goal of these tools is to provide a streamlined and enhanced gaming experience through automated, intelligent game-play functions.

## Main Features

- **Window Targeting and Rescaling**: Automatically detects and targets the game window, rescaling and re-centering it according to default pixel patterns.
- **Resolution Morphing**: Supports different screen sizes and resolutions through dynamic automation.
- **Parallel Processing**: Core engine uses parallel processing with threads, combining image analysis and an AI-based knowledge base to continuously understand and react to the game's world.

## Detailed Features

### 1. Auto Hunter
- **Loot Parsing and Custom Item Detection**: Identifies and collects desired items based on customizable detection patterns.
- **Complex Stuck Logic**: Monitors character position using coordinate-based detection to handle stuck situations (high stability).
- **Auto-Healing**: Heals the character automatically when health drops below a specified threshold.
- **Customizable Patterns**: Create custom hunting patterns or use pre-existing, pre-tested ones for efficiency.

### 2. Auto Leveler
- **Multiple Leveling Versions**:
  - **Version 1**: Uses pixel recognition in a spiral search pattern to identify and interact with targets.
  - **Version 2**: Combines image recognition and AI-based image processing for enhanced target detection.
  - **Version 3 (Most Efficient)**: Utilizes a close-character mass-spamming pattern that exploits game mechanics. Adjusts character attack speed by optimizing click intervals (as fast as 0.05s).
- **Advanced Handling**: Includes complex close-character patterns and handlers for healing, loot collection, and handling stuck situations.

### 3. Auto Socketer
- **Image-Based Recognition**: Uses image analysis to map the locations of necessary NPCs, allowing free movement of in-game UIs on the screen.
- **Automated Socketing Cycles**: Automates one of the game's most physically demanding tasks, significantly reducing manual effort.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Uses parallel processing to monitor socketing success, stop cycles in case of interference, track successfully socketed items, and move them to a secure warehouse.

### 4. Auto Marketer
- **Web Scraping**: Continuously scrapes online databases for current market items.
- **Custom Alerts**: Notifies the user when items appear within specified parameters.
- **Flexible Searches**: Allows users to set up complex, custom search criteria.

## Technologies Used

- **Deep Learning and AI**: Utilized for building a knowledge base and decision-making.
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV and other image processing libraries for game window detection, pattern recognition, and in-game automation.
- **Parallel Processing**: Multithreading to handle multiple automation tasks simultaneously.
- **Automation Tools**: `pyautogui` for automated control of the game interface.
- **Data Analysis**: `numpy` and other libraries for efficient data manipulation.
- **Web Scraping**: Libraries such as `BeautifulSoup` and `requests` for market data gathering.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries: `numpy`, `opencv-python`, `pyautogui`, `beautifulsoup4`, `requests`, etc.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vip-services-for-online-game.git
